        <h1>Instructions for batch edits</h1>

        <p>These instructions are for SCAGI members. It is important to note that a CSV file is used as the upload file so that diacritics are maintained. If you open your CSV file in a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel, the diacritics will be corrupted</p>
